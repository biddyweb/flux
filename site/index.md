Welcome to the Weave Flux documentation! TODO: one sentence summary of
flux here.

* TODO short bullet-point feature list
* Flux does not require the use of Weave Net or any other Docker network
plugin, although it does work with them.

If you are new to Flux, you might want to start with
[the Introduction](intro).

Flux is alpha software.  There may be rough edges, and it is still
evolving.  We are making preliminary releases in order to gather
feedback, so please let us know your thoughts. You can file an issue
on the [github repo](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/), or contact
us on any of the channels mentioned on the [Weaveworks help
page](http://www.weave.works/help/).
